# Redability Test for Researchers 

Use this [minimal readability tool](https://imarijoyborda.com/readability/) to see and check that your text is not too verbose. Supports unlimited text length. Designed for researchers and writers who have long texts. 

My motivation: As someone from the research field, it is easy to be carried away when writing scientific papers to the point that it becomes unnecessarily wordy. I develop this readability tool to help me check my texts and ensure that it is still readabale. Other readability tests online exists but most of them are not minimalist and some have text length limit. As a researcher who also deals with confidential data, I also have reservations on using online tools that sends our texts to third-party servers. Meanwhile, this readbaility tool I've developed runs purely on client side so privacy of text is ensured.

## How To Use
Enter the text in the text box. Click  `Submit Text` to see the result. 

The test uses the Colemanâ€“Liau index (CLI) to calculate the grade level. The result approximates the U.S. grade level thought necessary to comprehend the text. The lowest grade level is `Before Grade 1` while the highest is `Grade 16+`. The lower the grade level is, the easier the text can be comprehended.

## How It's Made
Tech used: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/book" title="book icons">Book icons created by Smashicons - Flaticon.</a>

## Future Improvements
There are still lots that need to be improved in this web application. Some plans are:
* Add support for other readability test.
* Allow upload of texts. 

Contributions are also very welcome! Just issue a pull request.
