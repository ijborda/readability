## How To Use
Enter the text in the text box. Click  `Submit Text` to see the result. 

The test uses the Colemanâ€“Liau index (CLI) to calculate the grade level. The result approximates the U.S. grade level thought necessary to comprehend the text. The lowest grade level is `Before Grade 1` while the highest is `Grade 16+`. The lower the grade level is, the easier the text can be comprehended.
